        Q1. Explain the role of operators in JavaScript. Why are they essential in programming?
    </h1>

    <p>

        Operators in JavaScript are symbols or keywords that perform operations on variables and values. They allow you
        to manipulate and perform calculations on data, making your code dynamic and interactive. Operators are
        essential because they enable you to express logic, perform comparisons, and handle data in a way that is
        fundamental to programming.
    </p>

    <h1>

        Q2. Describe the categorization of operators in JavaScript based on their functionality. Provide examples for
        each category.
    </h1>
    <h2>

        Arithmetic Operators:
    </h2>

    <p>

        let addition = 5 + 3; // 8
        <br>
        let subtraction = 10 - 4; // 6
        <br>
        let multiplication = 2 * 6; // 12
        <br>
        let division = 8 / 2; // 4
        <br>
        let modulus = 10 % 3; // 1
        <br>
        Comparison Operators:
        <br>

        let isEqual = (a === b); // Strict equality
        <br>
        let isNotEqual = (a !== b); // Strict inequality
        <br>
        let greaterThan = (a > b);
        <br>
        let lessThan = (a < b); <br>
            Logical Operators:
            <br>


            let andOperator = (x && y); // Logical AND
            <br>
            let orOperator = (x || y); // Logical OR
            <br>
            let notOperator = !x; // Logical NOT
            <br>
            Assignment Operators:

            <br>

            let x = 10;
            <br>
            x += 5; // x is now 15 (x = x + 5)
            <br>
            Unary Operators:
            <br>


            let a = 5;
            <br>
            a++; // Increment: a is now 6
            <br>
            a--; // Decrement: a is now 5
            <br>
            Ternary Operator:

            <br>

            let result = (condition) ? "true case" : "false case";
    </p>
    <h1>

        Q3. Differentiate between unary, binary, and ternary operators in JavaScript. Give examples of each.
    </h1>

    <h3>


        Unary Operators: Operate on a single operand.
    </h3>

    <p>

        <br>
        let x = 5;
        <br>
        x++; // Increment (Unary): x is now 6
        <br>
        Binary Operators: Operate on two operands.
        <br>
        <br>
        let y = 10;
        <br>
        let sum = x + y; // Addition (Binary): sum is 16
        <br>
        Ternary Operator: Operates on three operands.
        <br>
        <br>
        let result = (x > y) ? "x is greater" : "y is greater";
    </p>
    <h1>

        Q4. Discuss the precedence and associativity of operators in JavaScript. Why is understanding these concepts
        important?
    </h1>
    <h3>

        Precedence: Determines the order of evaluation when multiple operators are present. Higher precedence operators
        are evaluated first.
        Example:
    </h3>

    <p>
        <br>
        let result = 2 + 3 * 4; // Multiplication has higher precedence
        <br>
        // Result: 14 (3 * 4) + 2
        <br>
        Associativity: Defines the order of evaluation for operators with the same precedence. It can be left-to-right
        or right-to-left.
        <br>
        Example:
        <br>
        <br>
        let result = 10 - 5 + 2; // Left-to-right associativity
        <br>
        // Result: (10 - 5) + 2 = 7
        <br>
        Understanding these concepts is important for writing correct and predictable code, as they impact the order in
        which operations are performed.

        Question 1: Explain what JavaScript is and its role in web development.
    </h1>
    <p>

        JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming language primarily used for creating dynamic and interactive
        content on websites. It is a key component in web development, allowing developers to enhance the user
        experience by creating responsive and interactive web pages. JavaScript can be executed directly in web
        browsers, making it an essential technology for client-side scripting. It enables functionalities such as form
        validation, DOM manipulation, asynchronous requests (AJAX), and interactive user interfaces.

    </p>
    <h1>

        Question 2: Explain the key differences between JavaScript and HTML. Provide examples of situations where you
        would use each.
    </h1>
    <p>

        JavaScript:

        Programming language.
        Used for adding interactivity and dynamic behavior to web pages.
        Example: Form validation, image sliders, interactive maps.
        HTML:

        Markup language.
        Used for structuring content on the web.
        Example: Creating headings, paragraphs, lists, and defining the structure of a webpage.
        In summary, HTML provides the structure of a webpage, while JavaScript adds behavior and interactivity.

    </p>
    <h1>

        Question 3: List and describe the five primitive data types in JavaScript.
    </h1>
    <p>
        <br>
        Number: Represents numeric values.
        <br>
        <br>
        let num = 42;<br>
        String: Represents textual data.
        <br>
        <br>
        let text = "Hello, World!";<br>
        Boolean: Represents true or false values.
        <br>
        <br>
        let isTrue = true;<br>
        Null: Represents the intentional absence of any object value.
        <br>
        <br>
        let nullValue = null;<br>
        Undefined: Represents a variable that has been declared but not assigned a value.
        <br>
        <br>
        let undefinedValue;
    </p>
    <h1>

        Question 4: What is the purpose of declaring variables in JavaScript, and how do you declare them using the
        'let' keyword?
    </h1>
    <p>

        Declaring variables in JavaScript is essential for storing and manipulating data. Variables provide a way to
        reference and reuse values in your code. The let keyword is used to declare variables. For example:
        <br>
        let myVariable = "This is a variable";
        <br>
        In this example, myVariable is declared and assigned the string value "This is a variable."

    </p>
    <h1>

        Question 5: Explain the importance of comments in JavaScript and provide examples of single-line and multi-line
        comments.
    </h1>
    <p>

        Comments in JavaScript are used to add explanations or notes to the code. They are ignored by the JavaScript
        interpreter and serve as documentation for developers.<br>
        <br>
        Single-line comment:
        <br>
        <br>
        // This is a single-line comment<br>
        let x = 10; // Variable x is assigned the value 10<br><br>
        Multi-line comment:
        <br>
        <br>
        /*
        This is a multi-line comment.<br>
        It can span multiple lines.<br>
        */<br>
        let y = 20;<br>
        Comments help make code more understandable, especially for others who might read or collaborate on the code.
    </p>

        Question 6: Explain the importance of choosing meaningful and descriptive variable names in JavaScript. Provide
        an example where using a clear identifier improves code readability.
    </h1>
    <p>
        <br>
        Choosing meaningful variable names is crucial for code readability and maintenance. Clear identifiers make it
        easier for developers to understand the purpose of variables. For example:
        <br>

        // Unclear variable name
        <br>
        let a = 5;<br>
<br>
        // Clear variable name
        <br>
        let numberOfStudents = 5;
